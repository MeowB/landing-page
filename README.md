## Overview

## My process

I began by analyzing the design and identifying which HTML tags would be most appropriate. Even for a single-component page, I strived to use the most relevant HTML possible. I then started to build the components from top to bottom separating them in three main sections bein Header, Content and Footer

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- React
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I have learned how to work on a figma design and how react was used using components .


### Continued development

I found react to be enjoyable and challenging, and I want to continue to develop my skills in this area.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox cheatsheet](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to remember the different propreties of flexbox and align my content
- [ChatGpt](https://chat.openai.com/) - I used chatGpt to help me write this markdown and to direct me when i was lost coding
